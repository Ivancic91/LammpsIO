   contain the root `toctree` directive.

LammpsIO
========

LammpsIO is a python library developed to facilitate easy input/output
of `LAMMPS <https://lammps.sandia.gov/>`_ trajectories developed by 
Robert Ivancic in the `Riggleman <http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/>`_ group.
Currently the code can only deal with dump (lammpstrj) files and netCDF
files in `AMBER <http://ambermd.org/netcdf/nctraj.xhtml>`_ format, but
I have plans to add a log.* reader as well.
